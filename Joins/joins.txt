Joins in MySQL

1.

JOIN only returns customers who have sales reps, LEFT JOIN returns all customers and RIGHT JOIN returns all sales reps.

JOIN 
    Results Returned: 100
    NULL: N/A

LEFT JOIN
    Results Returned: 122
    NULL: salesRepEmployeeNumber, firstName, lastName

RIGHT JOIN
    Results Returned: 108
    NULL: customerName, customerNumber, salesRepEmployeeNumber

2.

JOIN returns employees who have an office, LEFT JOIN returns all employees, RIGHT JOIN returns all offices. All of these queries return the same results and have no NULL because every employee has an office.

    NULL: N/A

LEFT JOIN
    Results Returned: 23
    NULL: N/A

RIGHT JOIN
    Results Returned: 23

3.

JOIN returns all customers who placed orders, LEFT JOIN returns all customers include those who have not placed orders and RIGHT JOIN returns all orders. I don't really understand why there is an extra result for RIGHT JOIN.

    NULL: N/A
